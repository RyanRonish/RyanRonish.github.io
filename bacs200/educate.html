            Some of us learn best in the classroom, and some of us ... well, we
            don't. But we still love to learn -- we just need to find the way
            that works for us. In this charming, personal talk, author John
            Green shares the community of learning that he found in online
            video.

            Salman Khan talks about how and why he created the remarkable Khan
            Academy, a carefully structured series of educational videos
            offering complete curricula in math and, now, other subjects. He
            shows the power of interactive exercises, and calls for teachers to
            consider flipping the traditional classroom script -- give students
            video lectures to watch at home, and do "homework" in the classroom
            with the teacher available to help.

            Sir Ken Robinson makes an entertaining and profoundly moving case
            for creating an education system that nurtures (rather than
            undermines) creativity.

            Robinson, world-renowned education and creativity expert and
            recipient of the RSA's Benjamin Franklin award.

            Ever wondered why kids say theyâ€™re bored at school, or why they stop
            trying when the work gets harder? Educationalist Carol Dweck
            explains how the wrong kind of praise actually *harms* young people.

            In this early RSA Animate Matthew Taylor explores how brain and
            behaviour research is increasingly being incorporated into political
            and policy debate.
