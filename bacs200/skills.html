            <p class="fragment grow">
              Discipline -> I need better discipline when it comes to time
              management. I can fix this by planning out my work schedule and
              social schedule out, and sticking to the plan when I make it.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment shrink">
              Patience -> I need to be more patient in how I approach big tasks
              and projects. I need to understand you can't learn everything at
              once, these things take time.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment fade-out">
              Confidence -> I often lack confidence in myself and my ideas. I
              need to believe in myself more and believe in my ideas.

          <h4>Learning Scale</h4>
          <p>
            In most things I do and try to get better at I would say I'm between
            Compentent and Procicient, with the amount of hours I commit to
            accomplishing things.
          </p>
          <h4>Investment</h4>
          <p>
            In order to become a Full Stack Developer, I need to invest more
            time in exploring languages and software to get better.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to do so I need to be patient with the learning process and
            always have a growth mindset.
          </p>
          <p>
            I need to commit 500 - 1000 hours to any language or web service I
            want to improve with.
