        <p>
          What are the positive impacts of social media that are often
          overlooked?

        <h3>Political implications</h3>
        <p>
          It can be hard to find the benefits of social media. One benefit of
          social media is the distribution of information is far easier with
          social media platforms. This has leveled the playing field in
          elections for canidates challenging incumbants. Both Congresswoman
          Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former President Donald Trump utilized
          social media platforms to win elections against established
          politicians.
        </p>

        <h3>Economic implications</h3>
        <p>
          Financial markets were disrupted when the WSB traders decided to mount
          a successful short squeeze on companies they liked. Social media was
          used as a vessel to democritize trading for individuals who believed
          the markets were largely unfair and rigged against them.
        </p>

        <h3>Social implications</h3>
        <p>
          In addition, social media has increased the ease for crowdsourcing. An
          example of this was when MIT brought 10,000 users to its crowdsourcing
          platform that gave birth to HEAT which is a energy assessment
          technology that is helping fight climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly social media has increased the access to learning communities
          for both privleged and underprivleged students. "Overwhelming evidence
          on the positive impact of social media for immigrants learning
          eanglish" (Barrot, 2021). There are many avenues within social media
          platforms where students can go to expand their educational horizons.
